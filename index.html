                <p>What does this mean? The path you take is your own. Yes, but what does that say about the path you
                    take? Every purpose is unique.</p>
                <p>You are entitled to go your own way, but how? Where?

                    To be clear, it's your career. Maybe the sites you build are your sites. It's your life.

                    Do you like it? Do you learn from it? If not, find another journey.

                    Life is too short to be doing something you don't enjoy.

                    But don't let that be a cop out.

                    "Leave no trace."

                    Hike your own hike if you aren't leaving wreckage behind you. Make sure you aren't negatively
                    impacting those around you.Enjoy the experience.</p>
